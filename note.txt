We just published our local git repo
to remote Github.com repository
Few things happened:
It automatically created new Remote Repo under your Github.com account


now our work will continue locally

1. We added a new file called note.txt
2.commited the change to local repo
3. we want this change to be reflected in
remote repository, so we push local commit to local repository using push origin button
4. Observe has been added in your repositiry under github.com


How to save after adding some text in sublime?

We do not have to push one commit at the time
You can push multiple commit in one shot 
there is no limit
